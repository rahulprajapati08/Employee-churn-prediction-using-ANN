# ðŸ§  Employee Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This project uses an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization, based on historical HR data. Itâ€™s a hands-on demonstration of applying **deep learning** techniques to a real-world business problem â€” employee attrition.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- ðŸ—‚ **Dataset**: HR Analytics dataset for employee churn
- ðŸ§  **Model**: Multi-layer ANN using Keras (TensorFlow backend)
- ðŸ“Š **Tech Stack**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- ðŸŽ¯ **Goal**: Build a predictive model that classifies employees into â€˜Will Leaveâ€™ or â€˜Stayâ€™

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- Data preprocessing and encoding of categorical features
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- ANN architecture design with multiple dense layers
- Model training, evaluation, and accuracy tracking
- Visualization of training history (loss & accuracy)
- Confusion matrix for performance analysis
